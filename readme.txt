Use iso shortcode to pull post or pages while using Isotope js to filter or sort. Built off of loop shortcode.

== Description ==
Iso Plugin Shortcode

Create a dynamic and interactive way to present posts.

== Example ==

[iso query="posts_per_page=5&tag=tag-1,tag2" container="bus" view="simple_modal" gutter="20"  box_width="265" filter="dropdown" filter_title="The Filter Title" searchable=“true” help="false"]

== Breakdown ==

* query: please go here for options on the query.

* container: sets the container surrounding the posts boxes. (The default is \"iso\")

* view: A preset look and feel controlled by the options listed below (Please note: that if no view or a spelling mistake is made then the view will default to custom_modal):

** simple (default): creates a simple clean look.

** simple_modal: creates a simple clean look while activing modal box popup to posts.

** block: creates a blocky clean look.

** block_modal: a blocky clean look while activing modal box popup to posts.

** custom_modal: a view with minor CSS applied plus modal box popup to posts.

** custom: a view with minor CSS.

** list: creates a list of posts that is filterable.

* gutter: specify the gutter width (this option only accepts numerical values)

* box_width: specify the box width (this option only accepts numerical values)

* filter: sets up a list of links or a drop down to sort post on the fly. Currently the list generated by alphabetical order. Filter uses tags for filtering. Please go HERE for more information on tags. Options listed below: 

** links

** dropdown

* filter_title: customize the title or text before the filter choice (Leave blank to show nothing).
*  searchable: set to true and search box will appear and allow the user to search the post/pages title or excerpt.

* help: shows the attributes or settings for the shortcode. Either:

** true
or
** falsse

== Customizing ==

Shortcodes have been created so the filter options can be used in a custom setup.

[get_the_date] : Similar  to [the_date] only this will show the date for each post in the loop; regardless if the post was posted on the same day as the previous post.

[plain_tags_slug] : Gets the post tags slug (NOTE: this tag is importat to use from within the loop. More below.)

[get_the_categories] : Gets the posts categories as links. 

== How to ==

When customizing the iso query it is important to use boxey class and the [plain_tags_shortcode] in the container that is housing the post. This will allow the filter option to work.

Most other shortcodes should work inside the iso loop.

== For Example ==

[iso query=\"posts_per_page=15&orderby=rand&tag=events,media,news,video-games,alumni\" container=\"iso\" gutter=\"25\" view=\"simple_modal\" box_width=\"260\" filter=\"dropdown\" help=\"true\" pagination=\"false\" filter_title=\"Why not filter something?\"]
<div class=\"boxey [plain_tags_slug]\"><h2><a href=\"[permalink]\" title=\"[the_title]\">[the_title]</a> <small>[get_the_date]</small>/h2>
[the_excerpt]</div>
[/iso]

==  Rules of Engagement ==

This shortcode is meant for only one use per page (Fun results will ensue if you try more than one!)

== Installation ==
Download and unzip the WordPress Landing Pages plugin.
Upload the iso-shortcode folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.
